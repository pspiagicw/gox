# `gox`

`gox` is a tool to manage binary golang packages.

## Features

- üì¶Ô∏è Compile and manage binary packages easily
- üî• Single static binary, no dependencies
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Blazingly fast
- üßπ Doesn't polluting your home directory or `GOPATH`

## Inspiration

Whenever you install a golang binary package (`lazygit/lazydocker/gh/micro` etc), it installs all it's dependencies into `GOPATH`.
It installs the binary into `GOBIN` which should be included in your `PATH` variable.

When you want to update the package, how to update it ?

When you want to remove it, you can remove the binary with a simple `rm` command, but what about the dependencies ?

Analogous to `pipx` and `npx`, `gox` installs the binary in isolation and symlinks it into `~/.local/bin`.
You can remove it easily and the dependencies were never in your way!

Also, it can manage your personal projects, so you can easily install and update binaries while development.

## Functionality

### Install

- Compiles the binary in a isolated environment
- Automatically installs it in the `~/.local/bin` directory.
- Provide `.` as a argument to install the project you are inside!
- Or provide a path on your system to manage the binary of your projects.

### Remove

- Removes the package instantly. 
- Any dependencies were never installed, so easy cleanup.

## Installation

You can download the binary from the [release](https://github.com/pspiagicw/gox/releases) section.
You can bootstrap `gox` from itself!

```sh
/download/location/of/gox install github.com/pspiagicw/gox@latest
```


## Getting Help

You can invoke `gox help` for help about anything. 

For more information about any subcommand run `gox help [subcommand]`.
